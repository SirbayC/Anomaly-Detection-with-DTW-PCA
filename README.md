# Anomaly-Detection-with-DTW-PCA
The two anomaly detection techniques (Dynamic Time Wrapping and Principal Component Analysis) were used in the lab for the Data Mining course at TU Delft.
- Dynamic Time Wrapping focuses on finding collective anomalies (sequences of anomalous points)
- Principal Component Analysis, used to reconstruct the original dataset and compare differences, focuses on contextual / global anomalies.
